# EMG-Pong-Game
This is the final project for ECE 16.

Authors: Vansh Singh, Brian Henriquez

This code reads, filters, and analyzes EMG data from the forearms. Then, using
this EMG data, we send a UDP packet to a Pong server to create an interactive
EMG-based game.

# Prerequisites
Python distribution like Anaconda with necessary modules

# How to run the program
Just start up the game using the main.py script.
Change UDP port and IP address in the mapping.py script.
Change Arduino port address in the main.py script.
